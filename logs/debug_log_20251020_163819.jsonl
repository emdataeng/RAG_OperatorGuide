Reference each image explicitly within the step description (e.g., *\"see image file: artifacts/images/SIF02_p032_img0049.png\"*).\n  - Include the file path of every referenced image in the `\"images_used\"` array.\n- Use **at least 3 relevant images** overall (if that many are available in the context).\n- Prefer images whose `heading_path` or nearby text best match the described step.\n- If fewer than 3 images are available, use all available ones and note this in the JSON (e.g., *\"Only 2 images available for this procedure.\"*).\n- If no images are available at all, include `\"images_used\": []` and add a note such as *\"No images available for this procedure.\"*.\n- Do NOT hallucinate new steps or images.\n\nSystem Instructions:\nTo take into account:\nChapter 1 SIF-400 -
